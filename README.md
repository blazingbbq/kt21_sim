# kt21_sim

## Running

Run using:

```sh
./kt21sim
```

Use the `--dependencies` flag to install required dependencies.

## Gameplay Notes

Wherever applicable, use `ESCAPE` to cancel actions and `RETURN` to confirm actions (and end them early).
Can also use `RETURN` while resolving attack dices in fights to automatically strike with the highest dice rolled.

During barricade deployment, rotate barricades using `E`, `Q` or `ARROW_LEFT`, `ARROW_RIGHT`.

Blue terrain is `HEAVY` and `OBSCURING`, while green terrain is `LIGHT` and `TRAVERSABLE`.
